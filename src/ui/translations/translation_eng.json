        "subtitle": "In 2010, we embarked on a joint mission to help orphans by establishing a foundation dedicated to supporting them and providing the right conditions for their well-being. Since then, we have implemented a wide range of projects aimed at improving the quality of life for children.",
        "text1": "During this period, we have completed a significant number of initiatives to make children's lives happier and more exciting. Our efforts are aimed at creating conditions for the development of children and providing them with the opportunity to find true friends, gain new knowledge and develop their unique talents.\nWe have successfully organised more than 24 children's camps, each attended by 100 to 180 children. These activities have created unforgettable adventures and a refreshing new environment for hundreds of children who have joined our programmes. At each camp, children had the opportunity to learn, develop, socialise and have the best childhood experience possible.",
        "text2": "At the end of each camp, for the last 4 years, children have been receiving their favourite magazine \"Your Way\", which we publish together with our team every six months to preserve memories and summarise the results of the camps. This magazine is a window into the world of achievements and journeys of our participants, and we are proud to be able to preserve this story.",
